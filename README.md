# InstaProject

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
No **UI Libary** used.


# Problem with Instagram :warning:

when the app tries to access the instagram url for search results it return [429] **Rate Limit**
try it locally while in dev mode it should work fine, probably problem with heroku.
